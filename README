resdiv tool, for resistor divider calculation

This program is for optimizing resistive dividers according to existing
resistor series. Available resistor series are E24, E12, E6 and E3.

When calculating resistive dividers it is usually hard to find a fitting
resistor pair that both are available in a known resistor series. This
tool is to help with that.

Command is:
./resdiv <input voltage> <output voltage> <max error in output voltage>

A good way to run this tool is to start of with very low error, for instance
0.0001 and then go up until you find a reasonable solution.

The program reports resistor values calculated, the difference between
selecting these values and the requested voltage output and the error in 
percent.

resdiv3 is for two outputs, for instance for the LM5060Q1 from National
Semiconductor.
